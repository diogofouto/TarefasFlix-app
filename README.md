# TarefasFlix-app

This is a household-chores app that I made to help my family coordinate around the house. You see, we are a family of eight...

It was inspired by Instagram: every user sees a "feed" that has all the tasks they need to do for the day.
Only the parents can assign tasks.

There is a gamification element: each task completed adds points to the scoreboard.
